# Input from Users



we can do this using the **read Enter your user name here:**

**Vicky**

**Your name is Vicky** command and it will make the shell user interaction possible in the command prompt



Example:

 		**read name**

 	\*\*echo "Your name is $name"\*\*



**Output:**

 	\*\*Vicky 				//input given by user\*\*

&nbsp;	\\\*\\\*Your name is Vicky\\\*\\\*













Make it more user interactable, do it using **-p** command along with the **read** one



Example:

 		read -p "Enter your name : " name

 		echo "User name is $name"

OUTPUT:

 		User name is Vicky Kumar Gupta
